## Developing & maintaining [Phisics.tech](https://phisics.tech) 
Currently working on [Phisics.tech](https://phisics.tech), a physics education website based on interactive simulations. Currently over 10,000 unique visitors from 114 countries. 



As I am in my senior year in high school, my dream is to study computer engineering in the United States where I see most potential in my learning career. However, I am unable to fund my education there. If by any chance you consider aiding me in the process, whether it be financially or otherwise, I would be honoured and more than thankful! I would love to hear from you in my email below :)
